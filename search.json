    "text": "Introducing…Frederick County District Three!\nFor this analysis, initially focused on estimating a vote goal from turnout and voter registration data, we will reference data from the last three gubernatorial elections.\nCounty council district three currently covers the area that has historically (from 2014 to current day) included the following precincts: 002-002, 002-004, 002-005, 002-008, 002-010, 002-013, 021-002, 021-003, 021-005, 021-006, 023-002, 023-003, 023-004, 024-002\nFor more information, see documentation related to 2021 redistricting, which moved the two northernmost precincts in district two’s previous map to district five. Thus, we will exclude these two precincts from our analyses as they are not relevant to the 2026 district two election.\nHowever, we will include data from other precincts that are no longer named in the current map, but historically were within its boundaries (such as _). See maps from 2014 and 2018 elections.\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'YEAR'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument."
